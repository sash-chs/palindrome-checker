# Palindrome Checker (C)

A simple C program to check whether an input string is a palindrome.

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc palindrome.c -o palindrome
./palindrome

## Example
The string is: racecar
It is a palindrome

### Note
- This program only checks for **one-word** strings (no spaces).
- It is **case-sensitive** â€” for example, `Racecar` will not be treated as a palindrome.
