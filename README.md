# Palindrome Checker (C)

A simple C program to check whether an input string is a palindrome.

## How to Compile and Run
You can compile and run the C program using the GCC compiler.
```bash
gcc palindrome.c -o palindrome
./palindrome
```

## Example
```bash
The string is: racecar
It is a palindrome
```

## Notes
- This program only checks for **one-word** strings (no spaces).
- It is **case-sensitive** â€” for example, `Racecar` is not a palindrome.
- The input string can have a maximum of 64 characters.
